# My Portfolio

 For this project we were asked to create a portfolio using Bootstraps open source CSS frameworks. We had to create a responsive 
 layout for each of our three pages. The pages in my portfolio include an "About Me" page, a "Portfolio" page and a "Contact Me"
 page. This is where I will add all of the projects I do at Coding Bootcamp as well as all my future projects.
